This project is built using ReactJS as the frontend and NodeJS as the backend.

How to run the project:

1. Open NeXT repo in the vsCode. Make sure open up the NeXT folder which contains both frontend and backend folders.

2. Open new terminal and access both folder (backend and frontend) in the difference terminal, and then run:  

        npm init -a
        npm install
        npm start
        
3. On the backend terminal, you can either run nodemon instead of npm start.
4. This project needed NodeJS to run on your local machine, you can install it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">here</a>

**Notes**

>><li>It is recommended to create the container with the NodeJS runtime if you just want to play around with the code, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container">here</a> is the link to create container.</li>
>><li>If your terminal cannot run nodemon, please install the nodemon globally, and if it not working, install nodemon on your Windows/Mac environment.</li>
